# bookgen
EPD opening book generator based on [Stockfish with variant support](https://github.com/ddugovic/Stockfish).

Bookgen extends multi-variant Stockfish by the possibility of automatically generating opening books for all supported chess variants, including standard chess, crazyhouse, giveaway/suicide chess, atomic chess, and more. Several methods for generation and filtering of positions in FEN format are supported. The output format is EPD.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/ianfab/bookgen/wiki) for documentation and usage examples.
